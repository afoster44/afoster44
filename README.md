### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex Foster, and I am currently a full-time full stack student at Boise Codeworks. I am thrilled to be a part of this adventure. Some days the adventure is definitely not as great as others, but good with the bad. Besides programming I love to spend time with my wife, and we have a child on the way! We also like to be outside including snowboarding, fishing, hiking, camping, dirtbiking, snowmachining etc...the list goes on haha. Thank you for visiting my page! Feel free to check out some of my "hacky" code aka not so great xD.
