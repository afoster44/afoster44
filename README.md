### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex Foster, and I am currently a full-time full stack student at Boise Codeworks. I am thrilled to be a part of the adventure coding provides. Besides programming I love to spend time with my wife, and we have a child on the way! We also like to be outside including snowboarding, fishing, hiking, camping, dirtbiking, snowmachining etc...the list goes on haha. Thank you for visiting my page! Feel free to check out my pinned repositories. I very much enjoy programming so far with a Vue front end built with a MongoDB/Node back end!
